Highlights
===========================================================

**Carbon Emissions Reporting!**
Stay on top of your carbon emissions contributions by enabling our new reporting feature! 
Initial implementation of carbon emissions reporting has now been added to the job information 
page. Monitor your carbon footprint in real-time and become inspired to better your 
relationship with the environment! Currently, this feature assumes global average values for 
carbon intensity and power usage effectiveness.

**History Archival Feature!**
Your history menu now has a new option move a history out of your active history and into an archive! 
When archiving a history, you will be presented with two options: one to “Keep the Storage Space” and 
one to “Free the Storage Space” taken up by the history. Keeping the storage space will keep the 
contents of the history where they are, allowing them to be restored at any moment, but will prevent 
the UI from allowing certain operations on the history. Freeing the storage space will prompt you to 
package and export the history to a permanent remote source as a backup snapshot, and then purge the 
history and its contents to free up storage space. There will be a simple list, titles Archived 
Histories, for you to explore your archived histories and restore and reimport them, as needed!

**Galaxy Notification System!**
The previous Galaxy notification system has been overhauled to support more complex scenarios and features! 
As users, you will now have more control of your notifications, including the option to subscribe/unsubscribe 
from certain times of notifications. The new notification system will also support notification broadcasting, 
allowing the Galaxy team to send server-wide announcements, such as User Agreement updates and server 
maintenance notifications. 

**Power User Features**
Attention long time Galaxy users! Are you looking to enhance your skills? Check out these new features 
to take your Galaxy skills to the next level!

**Visualize HDF5 Datasets!**
Users can now visualize their HDF5 datasets directly in Galaxy, thanks to the integration of the 
h5web visualizer (https://h5web.panosc.eu/)!

**Create New Activity Bar Items!**
The new option to create activity bar items allows users to drag items, including datasets and 
workflows, from the UI directly into the activity bar component! In addition, the context menu 
has been augmented, now allowing to search activities.

**Invocations Related to a History!**
Users now have the option to see invocations related to a specific history in Galaxy!
